>Beauty In Diversity is a piece that visualises the diversity in students, academic staff and learning opportunities at the University of Exeter. The different names in all shapes, sizes and colour come together to form something beautiful. It symbolises the people from such diverse backgrounds that come together to study at the University. It is a reminder that there is beauty in diversity and a visual representation of how diverse Exeter truly is.

>When my team came together, we realised that we all came from different countries, speak different languages and had different backgronuds. As a result of this interesting pairing, we decided to create a piece that would best represent our group's diversity and our understanding of it.
